Explanation
We first do maxSum -= n,
then all elements needs only to valid A[i] >= 0

We binary search the final result between left and right,
where left = 0 and right = maxSum.

For each test, we check minimum sum if A[index] = a.
The minimum case would be A[index] is a peak in A.
It's arithmetic sequence on the left of A[index] with difference is 1.
It's also arithmetic sequence on the right of A[index] with difference is -1.

On the left, A[0] = max(a - index, 0),
On the right, A[n - 1] = max(a - ((n - 1) - index), 0),

The sum of arithmetic sequence {b, b+1, ....a},
equals to (a + b) * (a - b + 1) / 2.


Complexity
Because O(test) is O(1)
Time O(log(maxSum))
Space O(1)
